## 1. Game description
Welcome to Key Hunter. Your task is to get 3 keys. Only when they are collected does the game end. The keys are located at the top of each map. You have 3 maps to complete, each of which goes up 3 more levels. We use the arrow keys and the keyboard to move. A normal jump is possible between some platforms, but if you want to jump further, you can also use a super jump. Be careful not to fall from high, as your character may crash to the ground. You can raise it by using the upward push button.
Enjoy the game.

## 3. Configuration and launch of the project
We used Visual Studio 2019 and the SFML library to write the project. To run the project, simply download it and place the .ddl files from the SFML library in the main project folder. It is worth paying attention to the configuration and selecting Debug x64. After doing this, the project should run without problems.

## 4. Copyright for graphics and music

The backgrounds were generated using artificial intelligence, in particular ChatGPT 4, while the music and sounds used in the game come from the Internet, mainly from publicly available soundbank's.
